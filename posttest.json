{"version": 2.0, "questions": [{"question": "A cold storage room has wall made of 0.21m thick layer of brick (k = 0.98W/m-k) on the outside. The middle layer is of 0.07m thick of plastic foam (k = 0.2W/m-k) and 0.015m inside layer wood (k = 0.17W/m-k). The outside and inside convective heat transfer coefficient and temperature are 12W/m-k, 22oC and 29W/m-k, -3.7 C respectively. Wall area is 93m<sup>2</sup>.
